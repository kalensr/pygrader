# pygrader
An experimental python application used to help execute and test student programs.
The application has been moved to a Jupyter Notebook for better execution and management of tests. 

ToDo's: 
* [in progress] Create unit tests
* Add example usage documentation - will record a video and embed in README
* X-make the tester data driven - where tests can be saved in text files and read by pygrader
* Jupyter Notebook eliminates the need for a data driven approach using seperate text files for tests.
